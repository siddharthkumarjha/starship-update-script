# starship-update-script 🚀

Currently Under Work ⚒️

This is a wrapper script for the starship's install script to update the system.

## Currently done:

- :ballot_box_with_check: Fetch remote latest repo version of starship
- :ballot_box_with_check: Compare the local and remote version to determine if updating is necessary

## Work to be done

- make a custom file that permanently stores all the flags user wishes to pass
- call the actual install script
- find the current install path of starship
- write documentation on how to use this script as update hook
